      "Pros: 1) The sections (not including VBA) were thoroughly explained. 2)There is a great amount of content.\n",
      "Cons: 1) The VBA sections did not provide enough foundation, simply went through examples without clarifying what the elements of VBA code did. 2) Video quality was poor on some of the sections throughout the course.\n",
      "Recommendation: I recommend the initial portions wholeheartedly despite the video quality. I think a more thorough VBA course may be needed to achieve the standard of earlier sections.\n",

      "However, there needs to be a warning for Mac users to consider taking a different course, since this one is focused on Windows users. Some of the features Mac simply doesn't carry (such as PowerPivot Add-In and creating VBA User Forms ). Also, cache needs to be deleted constantly/browser needs to be changed, in order for the sound not to disappear all of a sudden and in order to keep videos from freezing.\n",

      "Pros: 1) The sections (not including VBA) were thoroughly explained. 2)There is a great amount of content.\n",
      "Cons: 1) The VBA sections did not provide enough foundation, simply went through examples without clarifying what the elements of VBA code did. 2) Video quality was poor on some of the sections throughout the course.\n",
      "Recommendation: I recommend the initial portions wholeheartedly despite the video quality. I think a more thorough VBA course may be needed to achieve the standard of earlier sections.\n",

      "Amazing course, very practical contents, truly an Excel for Dummies kind of course, which I loved. Kyle is such a good teacher although he can take long to answer students' questions.\n",
      "However, there needs to be a warning for Mac users to consider taking a different course, since this one is focused on Windows users. Some of the features Mac simply doesn't carry (such as PowerPivot Add-In and creating VBA User Forms ). Also, cache needs to be deleted constantly/browser needs to be changed, in order for the sound not to disappear all of a sudden and in order to keep videos from freezing.\n",
